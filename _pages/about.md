I am currently pursuing my PhD with the [Distributed and Parallel Systems Group](https://dps.uibk.ac.at/) at the University of Innsbruck, where my research focuses on Cloud-Edge-IoT computing. I concentrate on _programming models_, _runtime systems_, _resource management_, and _scheduling_.

Before starting my PhD, I spent over a decade as a software engineer in various industries, primarily in computer graphics and digital signal processing. While my involvement in independent software engineering projects has decreased, I still take on select projects.

I have been programming since childhood and have experience with many programming languages. My preferred tools include C++, CUDA, C#, and Java, as well as frameworks like OpenGL, Vulkan, and OpenCV.

I welcome connections and conversations, so feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marlonetheredge/).
